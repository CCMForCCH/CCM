<h3>ORGANIZING A MONDAY COMMUNITY PIZZA POTLUCK MEAL</h3>
<p>
Ultimately the team leader(s) are responsible! Ensure all attendees are listed on CCM, 
invite people with birthdays to attend and celebrate, arrange for birthday cake (families 
often provide). Leaders announce the meal and who or what it is celebrating to community, 
establish the sign-ups, closing meal sign-up at 6 PM on Sunday. Place pizza order with 
<i>American Flat Bread Pizza</i> taking into account peopleâ€™s wish and health needs, put tab and 
tip on own credit card, identify who picks up by 5:45 PM, for 6 PM meal.  It is the leader(s)
job to stay within a budget: multiply the number of attendees paying for pizza by $10 to 
get total budget for pizza meal maybe including cake etc.  By community agreement kids 
count as half a sign-up but CCM cannot do half.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Ensure enough food for gathering, create a welcome atmosphere, ensure sanitary procedures
plus 2 hour safe-handling rule are followed, get pizza, hand receipts and accounting to 
Marianne, wipe kitchen counters and tables, wash dishes and put away, wash linens and put away, 
put away or send away all food, compost and trash and recycle each bagged and deposited in 
the community collection bins, the floor cleaned of food bits, outside door locked and windows 
closed, the lights off. Then remember the thank-yous and maybe set up the next pizza potluck!
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Enforce the understanding that <b>everyone attending contributes to provisioning the meal</b> either 
by helping pay a share of the pizzas (about $10.00 each when Dan issues bills) or bringing a 
potluck contribution of about 6-8 servings. People may bring their own meal, but we request they 
also contribute to the community meal by pay or potluck!)
</p>
